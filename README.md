# Baby Names 

## Introduction 

Every year the U.S. Government releases a data set containing information about baby names. From the most popular names to less common ones.
This repository contains a Java program to read CSV files and information about baby names from 1880 to 2014. 

## This program contains methods that can:

* Return total births of boys identified in the data set as Gender "M", and total births for girls identified in the data set as Gender "F" per year. (totalBirths())

* Return the rank of the name in the file for the given gender, where rank 1 is the name with the largest number of births (getRank())

* Return the name of the person in the file at this rank, for the given gender, where rank 1 is the name with the largest number of births. (getName())

* Determine what would your name be if you were born in a different year, based on popularity. (WhatIsNameInYear())

* Select a range of files and return the year with the highest rank for the name and gender (yearOfHighestRank())

* Select a range of files to process and returns the average rank of the name and gender over the selected files. (getAverageRank())

* Return an integer, the total number of births of those names with the same gender and same year who are ranked higher than name (getTotalBirthsRankedHigher())


## How to run the program 

I still have to make executable, but you can run using either BlueJ or any other Java IDE
